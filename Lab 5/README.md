In lab 5, we explored and programmed the VGA terminal of the DE1_SoC. We learned how to
use and generate signals from the DE1_SoC to create graphical displays and animations onto a
VGA board. We learned how to manipulate the pixel buffer, which allowed us to change what
was displayed on the screen. In Task 1, we downloaded and set up the starter files for the VGA
interface, and made sure the initial default settings worked on Labsland. In Task 2, we analyzed
Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm and understood how it works. We then implemented it into
hardware and connected it to the VGA, so we could draw lines on the VGA by defining the start
and end points. In Task 3, we took the line drawing algorithm a step further and used it to create
an animation. We created multiple lines and displayed them one at a time to make an animation.
We also worked to create a reset function which, if activated, would turn the screen fully black.
