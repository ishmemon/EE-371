In this lab we were tasked with working with and implementing memory designs. We were asked to create memory files from Quartusâ€™s library modules, 
from our own System Verilog code, and a library memory with its own read and write operations. We were provided with conceptual RAM and RAM register
diagrams to implement into design and code through System Verilog. Depending on the task, the DE1_SoC board was used to simulate RAM input 
and output with switches SW3-SW1 specifying DataIn, switches SW8-SW4 specifying address, SW0 as the Write signal and KEY0 as the Clock input.
