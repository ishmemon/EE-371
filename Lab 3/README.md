In this lab, we were required to perform tasks using the Audio CODEC interface to generate and filter our audio. 
Our first task was implementing a given audio sound system to produce an audio output when the CODEC was ready that matched 
the given input audio. The second task involved creating a static tone based off of a chosen note through a ROM created by Quartusâ€™s libraries.
The note was stored in the ROM through a MIF file and outputted through the Audio CODEC on a loop to play a static tone.
The third task consisted of creating an averaging Finite Impulse Response filter. This was done through the use of a Fifo buffer and accumulator.
Task 3 required us to create an FIR (finite impulse response) filter to filter out inputted sound based on our sample size N value of 256.
