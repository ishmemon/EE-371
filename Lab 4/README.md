In Lab 4, we were tasked with creating and implementing an ASMD as a software
algorithm to be inputted into the FPGA board. In Task 1, we were provided with an
ASMD diagram for a 1 bit counter, which counted the number of 1â€™s out of an 8 bit
input, and tasked with implementing its design onto hardware. In Task 2, we were
tasked with creating a binary search algorithm that accessed a RAM. In the
algorithm, we split the array addresses for the RAM in half again and again based
on whether the user input was less than or greater than the value we were
assessing. If the data input was found, the address in the array MIF file was displayed
on the HEX0 and HEX1. If the data input was not found, LEDR[0] will not light up
to let the user know that the data input was not in the RAM.
