# EE-371
For Lab 1, we created a car parking lot detection system which kept track of how many cars were parked inside the lot and displayed
that information on a HEX display. The system also outputs when the lot is FULL (16 cars inside occupying all spaces) or when it is CLEAR
(0 cars inside with no occupied spaces). The car counter uses two sensor inputs “Inner” and “Outer” to determine if a car has entered or exited the parking lot.

Attribution: I complted these projects with my lab partner (Ishan Dane) for UW's EE 371 course.
