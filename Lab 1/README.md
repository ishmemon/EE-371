For Lab 1, we were asked to create a car parking lot system which kept track of how many cars were parked inside the lot
and displayed that information on a HEX display. The system also outputted when the lot was FULL (16 cars inside occupying all spaces) 
or when it was CLEAR (0 cars inside with no occupancies). The car counter used two sensor inputs “Inner” and “Outer” (with Outer represented by GPIO_0[6] and
Inner by GPIO_0[7]) to determine if a car had entered or exited the parking lot.
